# PlantCare_Module

# ! This readme will be updated after [PlantCare project](https://github.com/ArekStasko/PlantCare) migration to .net8 !

This is code that will work on ESP32 module to communicate with my PlantCare system.

The main operations that it will perform are : 
- Gaining informations about soil moisture level
- An exchange of information with PlantCare server

In the next days i will write more details.
